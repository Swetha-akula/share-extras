Javascript Console Admin Console component for Alfresco Share
=============================================================

Author: Florian Maul

This project defines a Javascript Console component for Share's Administration Console,
that enables the execution of arbitrary javascript code in the repository. 


Installation
------------

The component has been developed to install on top of an existing Alfresco
3.4 installation.

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the 
custom files, which can then be installed into the 'tomcat/shared/lib' folder 
of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project 
directory.

    ant clean dist-jar

The command should build a JAR file named javascript-console.jar
in the 'dist' directory within your project.

To deploy the dashlet files into a local Tomcat instance for testing, you can 
use the hotcopy-tomcat-jar task. You will need to set the tomcat.home
property in Ant.

    ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean hotcopy-tomcat-jar
    
Once you have run this you will need to restart Tomcat so that the classpath 
resources in the JAR file are picked up.

Using the component
-------------------

Log in to Alfresco Share as an admin user and navigate to the Administration
page. Click 'Javascript Console' in the left hand side navigation.
